## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Build Configuration Issue
**Problem:** Package.json was configured for Vite, but code uses Next.js  
**Fix:** Updated build scripts to Next.js commands  
**Files Changed:** `package.json` (3 lines)  
**Impact:** Build now works correctly ✅

```json
// Before
"build": "tsc -b && vite build"

// After  
"build": "next build"
```
