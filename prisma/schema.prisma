// Minimal Prisma schema for XDrive Logistics
// This schema only enables prisma generate to run successfully during builds.
// NOTE: This project uses Supabase for database access, not Prisma Client.
// The datasource URL is intentionally omitted as required by Prisma 7.x format.
// Prisma Client is not used at runtime - this schema is only for build compatibility.

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
